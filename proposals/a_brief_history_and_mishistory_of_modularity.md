# a brief history and mishistory of modularity

## abstract

> "MAKE IT MODULAR," they said. "IT WILL BE BETTER," they said.

modularity is a term so common in today's software industry, that
it's easy to uncritically accept it as a fundamental software
development priniciple. but what does "modularity" *actually*
mean? where does this idea come from? where is it going? this talk
will walk us through the technical etymology of "modularity",
stepping through the intellectual breakthroughs alongside the 
fast spread misconceptions. we'll conclude by exploring the 
implications of modularity's ill-examined history on both its
current use today, and where it's heading in the future.
