# npm and Node by the Numbers

## abstract
Every day, there are approximately 2,500,000 npm install events.
Each one of those events installs around 50 packages.

That's a lot of packages.

npm, combined  with the power and ease of Node.js's module
loading system, has heralded  a new age of modular architecture. This
talk will walk through some of the fascinating data that npm has been
able to collect recently about the node community. We'll make some
specific observations about the current node community's behavior
inside npm's ecosystem, pointing out critical moments in Node.js's and
npm's geneaology. We'll conclude by drawing several interesting
implications for the future of node and "the modular way".
