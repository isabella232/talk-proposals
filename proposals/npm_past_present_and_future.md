# npm past, present and future

npm has moved quickly since npm Inc. was formed 20 months ago, and it's worth looking back to help everybody catch up. This talk covers the roots of npm and the problems it was invented to solve, then gives an overview of some of npm's more useful and less well-known commands, showing how we solve those problems. It ends with a look forward, to new directions we're taking npm, especially tackling the challenges of front-end web developers using npm.
