## Description

Laurie Voss, npm’s CTO, gives a quick tour of npm’s greatest features, old and new, and 
demonstrates how they can be integrated into your workflow to make you better, happier, 
and more productive. Laurie will outline the most commonly used npm tools for starting 
a project, managing a project through development, test, and deployment, and managing 
teams and organization project work. He’ll focus in particular on workflows that will
