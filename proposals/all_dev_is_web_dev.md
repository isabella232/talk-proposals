# all development is web development

## abstract

an inflammatory and overly general title to be sure, yet
there's a fascinating kernel of truth: contemporary systems,
of a myriad varieties, have all begun to take on the key
characteristics of those systems developed on and for the web.
this talk will dive into the history of web systems, their
intrinsic properties, and then explore how the systems of 
today have actively appropriated these traits to adapt to the
present-day needs of the industry. this talk will conclude
with a discussion of how npm is one tool that is setting the
pace for the webification of systems.
