What everybody should know about npm

## Description: 
npm is six years old, but 80% of npm users turned up in the last year. That's a 
lot of new people! Because of that, a lot of older, core features aren't known 
about by the majority of npm users. This talk is about how npm expects you to 
use npm, and the commands and workflows that can make you into a power user. 
There will be lots of stuff for beginners, and definitely some tricks that even 
most pros don't know.
