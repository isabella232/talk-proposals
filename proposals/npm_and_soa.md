# npm and SOA

Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a once-popular pattern that is gaining currency again. This talk covers what SOA really is, what problems it solves, and what pitfalls to avoid when implementing SOA. It also covers how the popularity of node is feeding the re-emergence of SOA and vice versa, using npm's own architecture as a case study. It ends with an overview of best practices to use when deploying an SOA, from npm's own experience.
