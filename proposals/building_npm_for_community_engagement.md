# building npm for community engagement

the rise of internet culture, starting early on with twitter,
was tightly linked to the success companies enjoyed as a result of
building the capacity for end user innovation into their products.
not unlike these companies, a huge, and ever-growing part, of npm's
success has been it's ability to engage the community in
building tools for, with, and on top of the npm ecosystem. this
talk will dive deep into the strategy (and sometimes lack of
strategy!) that led npm to this point, and how we plan to maintain
and grow this engagement into the future for fun and profit.
